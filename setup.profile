# NOTES
# - APPS is occasionally used to reference tools installed outside the project.
#   It is also known as the base "installation directory".
# - PROJECT_NAME and SETUP_PATH are for debug purposes.
# - SYSTEMC_HOME refers to the installation location of SystemC - *NOT* the source
#   This typically exists under $APPS.
# - LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DLYD_LIBRARY_PATH are used for dynamically linked executables
# - PROJECT_DIR is used to locate the extern and include directories.
#
# - Key directories and files include:
# $PROJECT_DIR/
#   ├── CMakeLists.txt -- top-level used for regression testing
#   ├── GNUmakefile -- used by instructors for maintenance
